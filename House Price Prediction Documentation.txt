Project Title: House Price Prediction

1. Introduction : 
Brief overview of the project: Predicting house prices using linear regression and gradient boosting.
Purpose of the project: Explore the dataset and build regression models to predict house prices based on various features.

2. Code Overview : 
The code begins by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset (kc_house_data.csv).
Exploration of the dataset through descriptive statistics, bar plots, and scatter plots to understand the distribution and relationships of different features.

3. Data Exploration and Visualization : 
Visualizations include bar plots for the number of bedrooms, scatter plots for price vs. square feet, location, bedrooms, etc.
Exploration of geographical data using latitude and longitude with a joint plot.
Analysis of the waterfront's impact on price and floor distribution.

4. Linear Regression Model : 
Implementation of a simple linear regression model using the LinearRegression class from sklearn.
Feature selection and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training the model and evaluating its performance using the score method.

5. Gradient Boosting Regression Model : 
Implementation of a gradient boosting regression model using the GradientBoostingRegressor class from sklearn.ensemble.
Fine-tuning the model parameters (e.g., number of estimators, max depth, learning rate).
Training the model and evaluating its performance using the score method.

6. Performance Comparison : 
Comparison of the performance of the linear regression model and the gradient boosting model using visualizations.

7. Conclusion : 
Summary of key findings from the exploration and modeling phases.
Reflection on the effectiveness of linear regression and gradient boosting for the given task.
Possible areas for improvement or future work.
